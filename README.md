# DEFI Hardhat Project

1. Deposit Collateral: ETH/WETH
2. Borrow another asset: DAI
3. Repay the DAI

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
